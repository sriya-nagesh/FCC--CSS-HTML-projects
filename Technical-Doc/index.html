                            <p>
                              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented
                              scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                              language. Inside a host environment (for example,
                              a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                              objects of its environment to provide programmatic
                              control over them.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language
                                by supplying objects to control a browser and
                                its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                                client-side extensions allow an application to
                                place elements on an HTML form and respond to
                                user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                                and page navigation.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language
                                by supplying objects relevant to running
                                JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                                extensions allow an application to communicate
                                with a database, provide continuity of
                                information from one invocation to another of
                                the application, or perform file manipulations
                                on a server.
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects,
                              such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                              language elements such as operators, control
                              structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                              extended for a variety of purposes by
                              supplementing it with additional objects; for
                              example:
                            </p>
                          </section>

                          <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                            <header class="header">Variables</header>
                            <p>
                              You use variables as symbolic names for values in
                              your application. The names of variables, called
                              identifiers, conform to certain rules.You can
                              declare a variable in three ways:
                            </p>
                            <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                            <code class="code">var x = 42.</code>
                            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                            <code class="code">x = 42.</code>
                            <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                            <code class="code">let y = 13.</code>
                          </section>

                          <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
                            <header class="header">Constants</header>
                            <p>
                              You can create a read-only, named constant with
                              the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                              identifier is the same as for a variable
                              identifier: it must start with a letter,
                              underscore or dollar sign and can contain
                              alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                            </p>
                            <code class="code">const PI = 3.14;</code>
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                A constant cannot change value through
                                assignment or be re-declared while the script is
                                running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                The scope rules for constants are the same as
                                those for let block scope variables. If the
                                const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
                                assumed to represent a variable.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                You cannot declare a constant with the same name
                                as a function or variable in the same scope.
                              </li>
                              <li>Object attributes are not protected</li>
                            </ul>
                          </section>

                          <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
                            <header class="header">Data types</header>
                            <p>
                              The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data
                              types:
                            </p>
                            <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                              <li>
                                null. A special keyword denoting a null value.
                                Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is
                                not the same as Null, NULL, or any other
                                variant.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                undefined. A top-level property whose value is
                                undefined.
                              </li>
                              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                              <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                              <li>
                                Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type
                                whose instances are unique and immutable.
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                              Although these data types are a relatively small
                              amount, they enable you to perform useful
                              functions with your applications. Objects and
                              functions are the other fundamental elements in
                              the language. You can think of objects as named
                              containers for values, and functions as procedures
                              that your application can perform.
                            </p>

                          <section class="main-section" id="If-else_statement">
                            <header class="header">If-else statement</header>
                            <p>
                              Use the if statement to execute a statement if a
                              logical condition is true. Use the optional else
                              clause to execute a statement if the condition is
                              false. An if statement looks as follows:
                            </p>
                            <code class="code"
                              >if (condition) { statement_1; } else {
                              statement_2; }</code
                            >
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                Condition can be any expression that evaluates
                                to true or false
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                You may also compound the statements using else
                                if to have multiple conditions tested in
                                sequence
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                              In the case of multiple conditions only the first
                              logical condition which evaluates to true will be
                              executed. To execute multiple statements, group
                              them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
                              general, it's good practice to always use block
                              statements, especially when nesting if statements.
                            </p>
